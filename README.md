# Musical Memory Game Project
Shaza , Amal and Mariam developing a musical memory game in IOT course at Technion.

Welcome to the Musical Memory Game project repository! This innovative project features a musical memory game with two engaging modes:
1. A musical memory game with a random sequence for users to follow.
2. A speed game mode where users must press the "on" button as quickly as possible.

Users can track user statistics through a companion Flutter app, enhancing the interactive experience.
